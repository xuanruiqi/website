                    <p>
                        I have just finished my M.S. in <a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/">computer science</a> at
                        <a href="https://www.tufts.edu">Tufts University</a>, and currently I am in a transitional period. 
                        During the summer of 2019, I will be interning at <a href="https://www.sifive.com/">SiFive</a>, where I will work with 
                        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vmurali15">Murali Vijayaraghavan</a> on formal methods 
                        and verification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Tufts, I was officially advised by <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~sguyer/">Professor Samuel Guyer</a> 
                        and was part of the <a href="https://tupl.cs.tufts.edu">TuPL</a> research group,
                        but I was (and still am) mostly working remotely with <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~comar/">Cyrus Omar</a>
                        (University of Chicago) and <a href="https://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~garrigue/">Jacques Garrigue</a> (Nagoya University, Japan).
                        I am currently working on extending <a href="http://hazel.org/">Hazel</a> with 
                        features such as polymorphism and programmable edit actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before I started working on my master's degree, I visited and did research at the <a href="https://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/">Graduate
                        School of Mathematics, Nagoya University</a>, in Nagoya, Japan, during the summer of 2018. While I was there, I
                        worked with <a href="https://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~garrigue/">Jacques Garrigue</a> on verifying dynamic,
                        succinct representations of bit vectors in Coq. Before that, I received a B.S. degree from Tufts University in May 2018. 
                        When I was an undergraduate, I majored in computer science and <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/ir/">international 
                        relations</a>, minored in <a href="https://math.tufts.edu">mathematics</a>, 
                        and worked with Professor Sam Guyer on redesigning Elephant Tracks, a GC tracing tool for Java programs. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>Interests</h4>
                    <p>
                        Much of my research interests revolve around types, for programs and for proofs. I am interested in a broad 
                        range of issues involving types.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am interested in expressive type systems for type-driven functional programming, and in making dependent types 
                        practical for verification and programming. For the former, I am interested in ML-like programming languages &mdash;
                        particularly, I am interested in mechanized proofs about and implementation of the type systems of <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a> 
                        (working with <a href="https://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~garrigue/">Jacques Garrigue</a>) and 
                        <a href="https://hazel.org/">Hazel</a> (working with <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~comar/">Cyrus Omar</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the latter, I am interested in the design of proof assistants based on dependent types. Particularly, I am 
                        interested in the intersection of dependently-typed programming and proof engineering. I am interested in formalizing and 
                        extending user-facing aspects of dependently-typed theorem provers using reflection and metaprogramming, and in 
                        extending current dependent type theories and 
                        languages to better support dependently-typed programming. I am also interested in using proof assistants, particularly
                        <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a>, to verify programs and mathematics 
                        (see <a href="#itp19">our upcoming ITP 2019 paper on verifying algorithms for succinct data structures</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In mathematics, I am mainly interested in constructive algebra, espcially mathematics developed using constructive type theory, 
                        and in the internal connections between topology, category theory and type theory.
                    </p>

                        My Erdős number is at most 5, via the shortest known collaboration path: <a href="https://staff.aist.go.jp/reynald.affeldt/">
                        Reynald Affeldt</a>, <a href="http://www-kb.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~koba/">Naoki Kobayashi</a>,
                        <a href="http://www.ru.is/kennarar/mmh/">Magnús M. Halldórsson</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~szegedy/">Márió
                        Szegedy</a>, Paul Erdős. I do not have a Bacon number, as I have never appeared in a film as of yet.

                        I am a functional programmer. When I hack on code,
                        my tools of choice are OCaml, Racket, (sometimes) Haskell and Erlang. My editor of choice is
                        the glorious Emacs, despite that it is well known that <code>ed</code> is
                        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.html">the standard and the best text editor</a>. 
                        My operating system of choice is <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>, and I maintain a few
                        <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=xuanruiqi">packages on the Arch User Repository</a>.

                        Before I started college in the U.S., I lived and grew up in Shenzhen, China. Now, I live
                        in Somerville, Massachusetts. I still miss not having below-freezing temperatures in the winter.

                        I prefer to be referred to by the singular <i>they</i>, especially in a professional setting,
                        but I am fine with <i>he</i>.
                    </p>

                        In an English-language setting, I often prefer to just be addressed as "Ray".  My Chinese name (Xuanrui Qi) is written 亓璇睿 in 
                        Chinese characters, and in Mandarin it is pronounced /tɕʰi˧˥ ɕɥɛn˧˥ ɻwei̯˥˩/ (in IPA). I find the best approximation 
                        (modulo tones) to be the Japanese katakana: チー・シュエンルイ. If you can read Hanyu Pinyin or Bopomofo
                        (Zhuyin Fuhao), it is pronounced [qí xuán ruì] or ㄒㄧˊ ㄏㄩㄢˊ ㄖㄨㄟˋ. By the way, even many native Chinese 
                        speakers cannot read the Chinese characters in my name.
